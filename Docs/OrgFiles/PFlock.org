** Plane sweeping [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gAYqIfYty7fKmKL8213BQ4HIsW_nD5Ks/view?usp=sharing][finding candidates]]
   - [X] Sort dataset by x-axis (extending STPoint case class to JTS Coordinate class).
   - [X] Set candidates and boxes data structures as RTrees.
   - [X] Feed band (RTree) with points en the 2-epsilon x 2-epsilon neighborhood.
   - [X] Find pairs, centres, candidates and boxes.
   - [X] Test implementation.
** Binary signatures
   - [X] Find MurMur3 and SpookyHash64 implementations.
     - [[https://github.com/mayconbordin/streaminer/blob/master/src/main/java/org/streaminer/util/hash/MurmurHash3.java][MurMur3]]
     - [[https://github.com/mayconbordin/streaminer/blob/master/src/main/java/org/streaminer/util/hash/SpookyHash64.java][SpookyHash64]]
   - [X] Sort boxes by left-bottom coordinate at the x-axis.
   - [X] Set M = 0 // RTree of maximals disks.
     - M: archery.RTree.
       - we need mutable.
       - we need remove some entries.
   - [X] Traverse sorted_boxes
     - iterate sorted_boxes using box'.
     - query boxes to retrieve intersecting boxes (the hood).
     - foreach box in the hood:
       - foreach candidate in the box:
	 - M = insertDisk(M, candidate)
     - remove box' from boxes
   - [X] Implement insertDisk procedure.
     - [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fvLfVZVSJtM7rQN3GiHAHurvToG4QmGM/view?usp=sharing][insertDisk(M, candidate)]]
** Test the implementation
   - [X] Run test with:
     - dummy
     - dense
     - LA_50K_T320
